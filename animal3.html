        <h2>Interesting Facts:</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Despite its name, the king cobra is not a true cobra but belongs to
            its own genus, Ophiophagus, which means "snake-eater."
          </li>
          <li>
            It preys primarily on other snakes, including pythons and even other
            venomous species.
          </li>
          <li>
            When threatened, the king cobra can raise up to a third of its body
            off the ground and look a person in the eye.

        <h2>Habitat:</h2>
        <p>

          across Southeast Asia. They prefer dense undergrowth and areas near
          water sources.

        <h2>Behavior:</h2>
        <p>
          Unlike most snakes, king cobras are known for building nests for their
          eggs. The female guards the nest fiercely until the eggs hatch. King
          cobras are shy and will avoid confrontation if possible, but they can
          be aggressive when cornered.
