          The Giant Panda is native to the mountain ranges of central China and
          is known for its distinctive black-and-white fur. Despite being
          classified as a carnivore, the Giant Panda's diet is primarily bamboo,
          making up over 99% of its intake.

            Pandas play a crucial role in China's bamboo forests by spreading
            seeds and facilitating the growth of vegetation. They are known for
            their playful behavior and their gentle nature, making them beloved
            by people around the world.

        <h2>Interesting Facts:</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Giant Pandas spend up to 14 hours a day eating bamboo to meet their
            nutritional needs.
          </li>
          <li>
            They have a special adaptation in their wrist bone, known as the
            “pseudo-thumb,” which helps them grip bamboo stems.
          </li>
          <li>
            Each panda has a unique pattern of black markings on its fur, making
            them identifiable to researchers.
          </li>
          <li>
            Pandas can climb trees and swim, although they prefer to stay on the
            ground.

        />
        <p>
          Giant Pandas are found in the mountainous regions of Sichuan, Shaanxi,
          and Gansu provinces in China. They thrive in temperate forests with
          dense bamboo undergrowth and a cool climate. The preservation of these
          habitats is crucial for the survival of the species.

        <h2>Conservation Efforts</h2>
        <p>
          The Giant Panda was once considered critically endangered, but thanks
          to extensive conservation efforts, its status has improved to
          vulnerable. Conservation organizations and the Chinese government
          continue to work to protect pandas and their habitats.
