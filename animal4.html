          The giant panda, native to the mountain ranges of central China, is
          known for its distinctive black-and-white fur. Despite being
          classified as a carnivore, the giant panda's diet is primarily bamboo,
          making up over 99% of its intake.

        <h2>Interesting Facts:</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Giant pandas spend up to 14 hours a day eating bamboo to meet their
            nutritional needs.
          </li>
          <li>
            Each panda has a unique pattern of black markings on its fur, making
            them identifiable to researchers.
          </li>
          <li>
            They have a special adaptation in their wrist bone, known as the
            “pseudo-thumb,” which helps them grip bamboo stems.

        <h2>Habitat:</h2>
        <p>
          Giant pandas are found in the mountainous regions of Sichuan, Shaanxi,
          and Gansu provinces in China. They thrive in temperate forests with
          dense bamboo undergrowth and a cool climate.

        <h2>Behavior:</h2>
        <p>
          Giant pandas are generally solitary animals, with males and females
          coming together only during the breeding season. They communicate with
          each other through vocalizations and scent markings. Despite their
          cuddly appearance, they can be as dangerous as any other bear species.
