        <p>
          African elephants are commonly found in diverse habitats such as
          savannas, forests, and deserts. They need vast amounts of land to roam
          and find enough food and water to survive. Elephants play a key role
          in maintaining the ecosystems they inhabit, helping to shape the
          environment and support biodiversity.
